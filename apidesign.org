Hackers are your users. And hackers, for the most part, admire
simplicity in their libraries, because they immediately recognize the
benefit that this simplicity brings when they are integrating your
library with their code — you know, the code that actually addresses
their problem domain. Even when there’s an underlying complexity to
the activities being performed, hackers appreciate a simple API to
work with because it frees up mental capacity to focus on the actual
problems. And, if there is advanced functionality to be had from
additional features, the default state of library code is to hide them
from the developer until he needs them — they don’t get in the way or
add confusion until the developer reads the documentation on those
advanced features.
